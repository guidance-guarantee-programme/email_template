You’ve previously registered your interest in the Pension Wise service. You can now take part in testing a phone appointment with a Pension Wise guidance specialist.

In the test appointment you'll discuss:

- the different ways you can take money from your pension pot(s)
- what each option means for you and your circumstances
- next steps you can take

The test appointments take place from 9 to 13 March between 11am and 4:30pm. They’ll last around 45 minutes.

If you're interested in taking part fill in this form - http://cati.totalsurvey.co.uk/limesurvey/index.php/558737/lang-en.

Places are limited but we'll do our best to accommodate as many people as possible. These are test appointments we run to improve the Pension Wise service. You shouldn't make any financial decisions based on them.

Regards

Pension Wise
