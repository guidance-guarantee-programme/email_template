Preparing for your appointment
------------------------------

To make your appointment as useful as possible, it would be helpful to have the following information with you when you have your appointment:
* the value of your pension pots - check your pension statement or you can ask your provider
* start thinking about how you want to use your money in retirement, whether you just need smalls sums or a regular income
* consider your financial circumstances as a whole, such as your salary and any savings â€“ this will help inform the context of your pension decision
* an estimate of your State Pension amount is helpful
