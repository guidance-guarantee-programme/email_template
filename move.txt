Preparing for your appointment
------------------------------

To make your time with us as useful as possible, it would be helpful to have considered the following information ahead of your appointment:
* the value of your pension pot(s) - check your pension statement or you can ask your provider
* start thinking about how you want to use your money in retirement, whether you just need money from time to time or a regular income
* consider your financial circumstances as a whole, such as your salary or other sources of income â€“ this will help inform the context of your pension decision
* a forecast of your State Pension is helpful - contact the Future Pension Centre on 0845 3000 168 to request this
