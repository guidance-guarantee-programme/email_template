Pension Wise


** Guiders Wiki Pilot
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi %recipient_fname%,

Thanks for taking part in this pilot of the guiders wiki. This pilot is about having a central place to store factsheets and find out about new ones when they come out.

The factsheets cover technical information on specific topics of pensions. You should have already received the first one through your technical support unit about financial advice on transferring safeguarded benefits.

During this pilot we'd like to communicate information about these factsheets via the guiders wiki and would appreciate your feedback.
