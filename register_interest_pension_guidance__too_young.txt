Thank you for having registered your interest in a Pension Wise guidance appointment.

Given your age indicated on the registration form, this type of appointment wouldn't be useful to you at this time. You can only take money from your pension pot when you’re 55 or over (or before this age if you’re retiring early because of ill health).

If the information on the registration form is wrong, go to https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/appointments where you’ll soon be able to find out how to book an appointment.

If you’d like further help on defined benefit pensions, you can contact The Pensions Advisory Service (http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk) or the Money Advice Service (https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en).

Thank you and kind regards,

Pension Wise
