Thank you for having registered your interest in a Pension Wise guidance appointment.

On the registration form you told us you weren’t planning to retire in the next 6 months. Pension Wise appointments are currently most relevant for people planning to take money from their pension in the next 6 months. You should consider booking an appointment when you’re closer to making that decision.

If the information on the registration form is wrong, go to https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/appointments where you’ll soon be able to find out how to book an appointment.

If you’d like further help on defined benefit pensions, you can contact The Pensions Advisory Service (http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk) or the Money Advice Service (https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en).

Thank you and kind regards,

Pension Wise
