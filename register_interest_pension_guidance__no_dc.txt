Thank you for having registered your interest in a Pension Wise guidance appointment.

On the registration form you told us you only have a defined benefit pension. Pension Wise only gives guidance on defined contribution pensions and an appointment wouldn’t provide you with the information you need. A defined contribution pension (https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/pension-types) is a workplace or personal pension based on how much has been paid into your pot.

If the information on the registration form is wrong, go to https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/appointments where you’ll soon be able to find out how to book an appointment.

If you’d like further help on defined benefit pensions, you can contact The Pensions Advisory Service (http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk) or the Money Advice Service (https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en).

Thank you and kind regards,

Pension Wise
