Thank you for registering your interest in the Pension Wise service. We’d like to offer you the opportunity to take part in testing a face-to-face appointment with a Pension Wise guidance specialist.

These appointments will be located in south-west London in the Carshalton & Wallington and Morden branches of the Citizens Advice service.

In the appointment you’ll discuss:

- the different ways you can take money from your pension pot(s)
- what each option means for you and your circumstances
- next steps you can take

The appointments will take place from Monday, 9 March to Friday, 13 March between 10am and 5pm, and will last around 60 minutes.

If you’re interested in taking part and happy to travel to one of these locations, please fill in this form  - http://cati.totalsurvey.co.uk/limesurvey/index.php/492799/lang-en.

These are test appointments we run to improve the Pension Wise service. You shouldn’t make any financial decisions based on them.

Thank you and kind regards,

Pension Wise
