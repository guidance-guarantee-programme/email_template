Pension Wise

Thank you very much for having registered your interest in Pension Wise. You may like to know that our website is now available at www.pensionwise.gov.uk (http://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/)

You'll find information on what you can do with your pension pot, how to shop around for the best deal, what to look out for with taxes and fees, and how to avoid scams.

We'll be expanding and improving this website in the next few weeks and welcome your feedback about it. You can leave your feedback by emailing beta-feedback@pensionwise.gov.uk (mailto:beta-feedback@pensionwise.gov.uk)

If youâ€™d prefer to speak to someone about your pension options, guidance appointments over the phone and face to face are also coming soon. We'll let you know when these are available (and just to note, you won't need to register your interest again).

Regards,

Pension Wise
