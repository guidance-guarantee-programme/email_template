Thank you for registering your interest in the Pension Wise service. We’d like to offer you the opportunity to take part in testing a face-to-face appointment with a Pension Wise guidance specialist.

These appointments will be located at the East Sutherland and Dundee branches of the Citizens Advice
service.

In the appointment you’ll discuss:

- the different ways you can take money from your pension pot(s)
- what each option means for you and your circumstances
- next steps you can take

The appointments will take place next Monday and Tuesday (23 and 24 March 2015) and will last around 60 minutes.

If you’re interested in taking part and happy to travel to either East Sutherland or Dundee, please fill in this form - http://cati.totalsurvey.co.uk/limesurvey/index.php/661974/lang-en.

These are test appointments we run to improve the Pension Wise service. You shouldn’t make any financial decisions based on them.

Thank you and kind regards,

Pension Wise
